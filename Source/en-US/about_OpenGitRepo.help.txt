SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The OpenGitRepo module provides cross-platform commands to open Git repositories in your web browser directly from the PowerShell command line.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The OpenGitRepo module contains the Open-GitRepo cmdlet which allows you to quickly open a GitHub or Bitbucket repository's web interface in your default browser. 
    
    This module works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, supporting both HTTPS and SSH remote URL formats. You can:
    - Run the command in the current directory to open that repo
    - Provide a local directory path (with -Path or via pipeline) to open that repo
    - Provide a git remote URL (with -Url or via pipeline) to open that repo
    
    The command detects your current branch and opens that specific branch in the browser for local repositories. For remote URLs, it defaults to the 'main' branch.

    The module simplifies the workflow of navigating between your local Git repository and its web-based interface, eliminating the need to manually copy/paste URLs or navigate through multiple clicks.

    REQUIREMENTS:
    - PowerShell 7.0 or later
    - Git must be installed and available in your PATH
    - For local paths, you must run the command from within a Git repository with an 'origin' remote configured

PARAMETER DETAILS
    -Path <String>
        Specifies the local directory path to the Git repository. This parameter is optional if the command is run inside a Git repository.
        
        Examples:
        # Open a specific repository by path
        Open-GitRepo -Path '/path/to/your/repo'
        
        # Open using pipeline input
        '/path/to/your/repo' | Open-GitRepo

    -Url <String>
        Specifies the remote URL of the Git repository. This can be used to open repositories that are not cloned locally.
        
        Examples:
        # Open a repository using its HTTPS URL
        Open-GitRepo -Url 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'
        
        # Open a repository using its SSH URL
        'git@bitbucket.org:user/repo.git' | Open-GitRepo

EXAMPLES
    Example 1: Open the current repository in your browser (Windows/macOS/Linux)
        PS C:\MyRepo> Open-GitRepo
        PS /home/user/MyRepo> Open-GitRepo
        PS /Users/username/MyRepo> Open-GitRepo
        
        Opens your default web browser to the current branch of the repository.

    Example 2: Open a repository by path
        PS> Open-GitRepo -Path /path/to/otherrepo
        PS> '/path/to/otherrepo' | Open-GitRepo
        
        Opens the web page for the repository in the specified directory.

    Example 3: Open a repository by remote URL
        PS> Open-GitRepo -Url 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'
        PS> 'git@bitbucket.org:user/repo.git' | Open-GitRepo
        
        Opens the web page for the provided remote URL (defaults to 'main' branch).

    Example 4: Using an alias
        PS> ogr
        PS> 'https://github.com/user/repo.git' | ogr
        
        The 'ogr' alias provides a shorthand way to execute the same command on any platform.

NOTE:
    The command will determine the appropriate URL format based on whether your repository is hosted on GitHub or Bitbucket.
    The module uses PowerShell's cross-platform Start-Process cmdlet to open the browser URL, which works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    
    Currently supported Git providers:
    - GitHub (github.com)
    - Bitbucket (bitbucket.org)

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE:
    If you encounter errors:
    1. Ensure you're inside a Git repository by running 'git status' (for local paths)
    2. Verify the 'origin' remote exists with 'git remote -v'
    3. Check that your Git installation is working properly
    4. If using SSH URLs, ensure your SSH keys are properly configured
    5. For remote URLs, ensure the URL is valid and public (or you have access)
    
    Platform-specific issues:
    - Windows: Ensure your default browser is correctly set
    - macOS: If your browser doesn't open, try running 'open <url>' manually
    - Linux: The module attempts to use the most common methods to open URLs
